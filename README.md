# losteering
Losteering is a set of semi-permanent orienteering tracks, proposed by the LOST orienteering club (https://www.lostorientation.be/autres-activites/LOSTeering)
The runner can run the race and validate the posts by scanning with the Sporteering mobile app (sporteering.com)

The routines of the losteering github enable to automatically download the sporteering results data, process them, and load them to a google drive repository
